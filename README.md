### Synopsis

- **Summary** :
 This is a Contao extension to put a Speisekarte on the site.

- **License** : LGPL v3 [opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html](http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)

- **Origin** :
 This is a fork from LinkingYou's [contao-speisekarte](https://github.com/LinkingYou/contao-speisekarte) v1.0.1.
 The original extension seems not to allow sorting of the foods.
 This fork was created to allow sorting.

### Features

- Create several **categories**, e.g. Main dishes, Desserts, Beverages

- The items appear **sorted** as you order them in the backend

- The categories can be sorted arbitrarily as well

- **Additives** and **allergens** can be annotated

- Instead of having one module with several categories, you can
 **create several modules** with one category each, which provides more
 freedom for the layout

### Planned features

- Allow for **images** beside the foods. Images shall be switched on/off in the backend.

### Users

You can find the contao-speisekarte applied e.g. on

- [www.thalermühle.de/restaurant/Speisekarte.html](https://www.xn--thalermhle-geb.de/restaurant/Speisekarte.html)
